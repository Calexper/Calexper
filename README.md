-Hey there. My name is Calexper. I am an Aerospace Engineer from Portugal whose always had a massive passion for Video Games and storytelling. 

I have constantly been learning how to make games on my own and I hope to one day transition into collaborating and making great video games for a living :slightly_smiling_face:.
